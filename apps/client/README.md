- Auth uses `/auth/register` and `/auth/login`.
- JWTs are stored in `localStorage` and sent as Bearer tokens.
- Cookies are also supported through `withCredentials: true`.
- Agent registration links Solana wallet data.
- Verification surfaces synced, simulated, or failed Solana proof status.
- The dashboard reads `/system/status` for Solana runtime details.
